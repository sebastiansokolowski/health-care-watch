Mobile Health Guard is an Android app to monitoring your health in the real time using sensors from a smartwatch. 
The app analyzes received data to predict:
- heart rate anomaly
- fall
- convulsions

When a health event has been found the app can:
- send an SMS to selected contacts with the user's location
- notify user by showing android notification

Each algorithm can be configured for individual needs.
